# Humbugs Confectionery Romsey

![Inside Humbugs Shop]({{ site.image_prefix }}inside.jpg)

Peter Speirs bought the old sweetshop Humbugs in Romsey with almost all the money he had, determined to make it into a success, and now after years of hard work, including lots of market stalls, town events, stands at school fetes and virtually every other kind of promotional activity, Humbugs is a thriving business.

The shop has become a genuine old-fashioned sweetshop, like those he remembered as a child. It turns out that many of his old favourites are still being made, itâ€™s just that most sweetshops these days do not stock them.

Humbugs today is a unique shop, with 70 year old ladies queuing up beside 8 years olds to buy sweets, and we wanted to bring you that same experience online. In order to do that we have had to take better than average photographs so you can see what the sweets really look like and make the user experience sensationally simple.

We hope we have achieved what we set out to do and that you enjoy both the experience and the sweets.
