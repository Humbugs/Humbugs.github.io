# Deliveries and Packing

Humbugs has strived to select a range of packing options and delivery services to offer the best in delivery speeds and security for the cheapest price possible. All Humbugs packing options have been tested for the safe transport of sweets in prime condition.

## Large Letter

Humbugs is proud to offer its innovative 'Large Letter' packing option. If selected, the order will be delivered in a box that can be put straight through the letterbox. As such, the order will still be delivered even if no one is home. This saves not only the headaches of collecting your package from your local collection point, but is also cheaper.

To qualify for this option, the order must be able to fit into Royal Mail regulation sized Large Letter box (32.5cm x 25cm x 2.5cm) and be under a maximum weight of 750g.
