# Terms and Conditions

You can order products online via the Humbu.gs website and the business is being conducted with Humbugs Confectionery Shop (HCS) in Romsey, UK (address below).

When you place an order for a product you are committing to buy it for the price stated, subject to these Terms.

When you place your order online we will send you confirmation that we have the order. We will then send you a further email once we have checked that we can fulfill the order and confirm the price to be paid. If the product is not available we will also let you know by email. All new orders are treated as separate transactions.

HCS may cancel any sale and not supply products if it is reasonable to do so and may change or discontinue the availability of products at any time at its sole discretion. If an order is cancelled, any payment made for the products will be refunded in full and this does not affect your Statutory Rights.

### Price

The price for each product is shown on the HCS site and will include any VAT that is due. Each order is checked when it is being sent and any errors found in the order will be corrected and that correction will be subsequently emailed to you and you will be given the opportunity of re-ordering at the correct price.

You are notified of delivery costs automatically before you submit your credit card details, based on the size of your order and the delivery address specified.

Prices are quoted on HCS in UK pounds - outside the UK your credit card company should exchange the amount charged to the currency of your country at the current rate. Both charges and refunds will be in UK pounds and HCS cannot be held responsible for any loss due to exchange rate fluctuations or charges.

While we are happy to support delivery to countries outside the European Union many non-EU customers will find they have to pay import duties and HCS cannot speak for the amounts involved, so please consult your local customers office for this.

### Payment

You must pay for your order before it is delivered and you can do so by credit or debit card (via the website). The only exceptions to this are for corporate accounts where it is pre-agreed by HCS that a company can pay by invoice. Invoice terms are 7 days.

To ensure that shopping online is secure, your credit/debit card details are highly encrypted to minimise the possibility of someone being able to read them as they are sent over the Internet.

Your debit/credit card company may also do security checks to confirm it is you making the order.

### Availability

We try to keep HCS as up to date as possible but, due to the nature and limited availability of the old-fashioned sweets that we sell, we cannot guarantee that particular product will always be available. If we can't supply a product we will not replace it with an alternative sweet without your explicit permission, which we shall request via email.

We may also offer you the option of having the product sent to you as a back order which will follow the remainder of your order as soon as the product becomes available or, alternatively, we will refund your payment.

### Deliveries

HCS delivers to destinations inside the UK and internationally.

UK orders are despatched either by Royal Mail (1st or 2nd Class) or by Courier. Our couriers require a signature and operate between 9am and 5pm on weekdays only, so please specify an address where someone will be able to sign for your products between these hours.

We will make every effort to deliver within the time stated on HCS, and we will not be liable for any loss caused to you by late delivery.

If the products are not delivered within the estimated delivery time which we quote, please contact us by email and we will try to ensure you receive your order, as quickly as possible, or if you wish you may cancel your order and we will refund the money you have paid.

Please note that while items sent by Royal Mail usually arrive within 2-3 days, Royal Mail stipulate that only items still not delivered after 15 working days can be officially classified as lost.

## Refunds

We believe that you will be delighted with your product but there may be occasions where you feel it necessary to return an item. We aim to keep the process as simple as possible. These terms do not affect your statutory rights.
We will try to attend to all returns as soon as is practically possible.

### Unwanted products

If you are unhappy with an item when you receive it or if you simply change your mind please return it to us within 30 days, with the despatch note, in unused condition, having taken reasonable care of it and in an unused state complete with packaging and all components, and we will refund you the price you paid for that product (excluding postage, packing and transaction fee).

We will make the refund directly to the credit/charge card used to place the original order within 30 days or earlier once we have inspected the returned item and are satisfied that it has been returned to us in the condition it was in when delivered to you. You will only have to pay for the return postage of the products. If the product is faulty in any way we will also refund your postage and transaction costs.

Our website contains links to other websites which are not under the control of and are not maintained by us. These links are provided for your convenience only and we are not responsible for the content of those sites.

Except as provided above we can give no other warranties, conditions or other terms, express or implied, statutory or otherwise and all such terms are hereby excluded to the maximum extent permitted by law.

HCS will not be liable in any amount for failure to perform any obligation under this agreement if such failure is caused by the occurrence of any unforeseen event beyond its reasonable control including without limitation Internet outages, communications outages, fire, flood, war or act of God.

HCS is not involved in the manufacture of products. Where we state information as to the contents of the sweets (e.g. whether they contain sugar, gluten or gelatine) we reproduce the information provided by the manufacturer. We do not guarantee the accuracy of this information.

HCS shall have no liability to pay any money by way of compensation, including without limitation all liability in relation to any incorrect or inaccurate information on the site; any interruptions to or delays; the infringement by any person of any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party caused by their use of HCS; any loss or damage resulting from your use or the inability to use the HCS web site.

HCS may terminate this Agreement and immediately remove, cancel or suspend access to and use of the HCS website Humbu.gs upon breach of any part of these Terms whatsoever.

Termination shall be without prejudice to HCS's other rights.
HCS acts as principal on its own account and not as agent for you or any other person and if HCS does not enforce any provision of this agreement such will not be considered a continuing waiver.

These Terms constitute the full agreement between you and HCS and may only be amended in writing. They apply to the exclusion of all other terms or conditions of contract proposed.

Use of HCS and these terms are subject to the laws of England and the jurisdiction of the English Courts.
